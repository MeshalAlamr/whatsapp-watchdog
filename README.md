WhatsApp Watchdog is a Node.js application to monitor Python scripts/services on Windows and send alerts via WhatsApp if the script/service is down. It regularly checks if a specified service (like a Python script) is running on the system and sends an alert through WhatsApp if the service is down. 


## Motivation
This project was born out of a personal need to monitor `update_sheets.py`, a Python script on my Windows machine that neede to be running 24/7. Therefore, I created this project to monitor the script and send me a WhatsApp alert (because it's more convenient for me) if the script is down. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeshalAlamr/whatsapp-watchdog.git
   cd whatsapp-watchdog
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

3. Set up alert recipient:
    - Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
    - Update the `.env` file with the WhatsApp chat ID you want to send alerts to. (e.g.,  `966123456789@c.us`)

4. Configure monitoring settings:
    - Modify `config.js` to set the monitoring schedule and specific Python script/service to monitor. 
    - The default configuration is set to check `main.py` every hour.

## Usage
1. Start the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. Link WhatsApp:
    - Scan the QR code in the terminal using WhatsApp on your phone (WhatsApp -> Linked Devices).
    - Once you see "WhatsApp Watchdog is ready!", the monitoring starts.
